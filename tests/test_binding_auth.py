"""Per-Thing auth resolution for HttpBinding.

A multi-Thing client shares one HttpBinding, so each request must
authenticate as the Thing that owns the action, with its own secret and
its own declared scheme. These cases lock that in (offline; no requests are
made; we assert the headers/params the binding would attach).
