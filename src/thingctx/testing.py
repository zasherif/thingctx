"""Conformance kit for the thingctx extension contracts.

Run these checks against any extension, built-in or third party, to prove it
honours the contract the runtime drives it through:

* :func:`assert_binding_contract` for a :class:`~thingctx.ProtocolBinding`: it
  names a scheme, exposes an async ``invoke``, and is consistent about the
  capabilities it advertises.
* :func:`assert_media_backend_contract` for a
  :class:`~thingctx.MediaBackend`: the pluggable engine behind ``MediaBinding``
  (PyAV today, GStreamer/GigE tomorrow). It exposes synchronous
  ``can_open`` / ``read`` / ``write`` that run off the event loop.
* :func:`assert_provider_contract` for a
  :class:`~thingctx.CredentialProvider`: it names itself, decides what it
  handles with a synchronous ``matches``, and resolves credential material with
  an async ``resolve``.
* :func:`assert_registry_contract` for a :class:`~thingctx.registry.Registry`: a
  discovery source that yields Thing Descriptions from a synchronous ``fetch``.

An adopter writing an extension uses these to gain confidence the runtime will
drive it the same way it drives the built-ins.
