"""``@implements``: an opt-in, readable way to bind a class to one or more
thingctx contracts and fail loudly at import time if it does not satisfy them.

    from thingctx import ProtocolBinding, implements

    @implements(ProtocolBinding)
    class SimBinding:
        scheme = "sim"

        async def invoke(self, action, form, arguments): ...

The contract itself stays a :class:`typing.Protocol`, so static type checkers
verify signatures with no decorator and a third party never subclasses anything.
This decorator adds the one thing a Protocol does not: a definition-time presence
check, the early failure an abstract base class gives, without inheritance. It
checks that every contract member exists and that methods are callable; it does
not re-check behaviour. Pair it with the conformance kit in
:mod:`thingctx.testing` (``assert_binding_contract`` /
``assert_media_backend_contract``) for async shape, generator shape, and
behaviour.
