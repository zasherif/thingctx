"""The shared resolution primitive: turn an owner's active schemes + secrets into
neutral credential material, transport-agnostically.

Both HttpBinding and MqttBinding (and any future transport) call this; it is
the single place that walks an owner's declared security, looks up the matching
provider, and resolves each into a :class:`Credential`. The caller then hands
the list to its transport applier (``apply_http`` / ``apply_mqtt`` / ...). No
transport specifics live here.
