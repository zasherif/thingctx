"""The context a provider needs to resolve one owner's credential.

Transport-neutral on purpose: no headers, no request object, nothing that ties
a credential to how it will eventually be attached. A provider that mints a
token may still call its IdP over HTTPS; that is the auth layer talking to an
identity provider, not the owner's transport leaking in.
