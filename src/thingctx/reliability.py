"""Cheap reliability for HTTP bindings: bounded retries with exponential
backoff and jitter, plus one normalized error shape.

A flaky network or a momentarily overloaded device should not surface as a
raw, transport-specific exception. ``send_with_retry`` retries the transient
failures (connection errors, timeouts, 429, 5xx) a small number of times, then
raises a single ``TransportError`` carrying the method, URL, status, and how
many attempts were made.
