    A binding that needs auth inherits this, calls ``self._init_auth(...)`` in its

    then hands the material to its own transport applier. This is exactly how
    ``HttpBinding`` / ``MqttBinding`` / ``MediaBinding`` work, so an extension uses
    the same path as a built-in. A binding that needs no auth (like the local one)
    does not inherit it.

    Holds the auth registry, the runtime secrets, and the schemes each owning
    resource declares; ``resolve_credentials`` (the transport-neutral primitive)
    turns those into :class:`~thingctx.auth.credentials.Credential` material.
    Each binding then hands the material to its own transport applier
    (``apply_http`` / ``apply_mqtt`` / ...), so no auth logic lives in the
    transport. Bind one resource with ``with_security`` or many with
    ``with_things``; supply secrets in ``credentials`` keyed by id, slug, or
    scheme name (looked up in that order). A scheme is only named; you supply
