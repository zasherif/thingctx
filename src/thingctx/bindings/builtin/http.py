    each owner's schemes into neutral credential material (see
    :class:`AuthMixin`) and maps it onto the request with ``apply_http`` --
    headers, query params, a client certificate, or request signing. No auth
    logic lives in this transport.

    Transient failures (connection errors, timeouts, 429, 5xx) are retried with
    bounded exponential backoff, and any non-2xx outcome surfaces as a single
    ``TransportError``. Retries are gated to idempotent methods unless
    ``retry_non_idempotent`` is set, so a write is never silently re-sent. A
    pooled client is reused across calls to keep connections warm.
