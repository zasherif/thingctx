    """Publish the action input to the form's mqtt topic, await a reply.

    Built on ``paho-mqtt``. The form's ``href`` is ``mqtt://broker[:port]/<topic>``;
    a request/reply ``invoke`` awaits the reply on ``<topic>/reply``.

    Authentication is the *same* transport-neutral layer the HTTP binding uses:
    bind resources with ``with_security``/``with_things`` and pass
    ``credentials``; the shared primitive resolves them into neutral material and
    ``apply_mqtt`` maps it onto the CONNECT (username/password, mutual TLS, or v5
    enhanced auth). A username/password scheme becomes username/password; a token
    becomes the password (token-as-password).

    Reliability is built in: the connect is retried with backoff,
    publishes/subscribes use QoS 1 by default, the subscription is
    **re-established on every reconnect** (paho does not resubscribe for you),
    and connect/reply failures surface as the same ``TransportError`` the HTTP
    binding raises. Pass ``client_factory`` to supply your own configured client
    (or a fake, in tests).
