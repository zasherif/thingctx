"""Protocol bindings: thingctx's transport extension point.

A binding speaks one transport scheme and answers the runtime through the
:class:`ProtocolBinding` contract (a ``scheme`` plus an async ``invoke``, with
optional read / write / subscribe / media capabilities). http, mqtt, media, and
local are the built-in bindings, shipped under :mod:`thingctx.bindings.builtin`;
each is only an implementation of the contract. Register your own binding to add
a protocol thingctx has never heard of, or to replace a built-in, with no fork.

    reg = BindingRegistry.default()   # http + local
    reg.register(OpcUaBinding())      # add a protocol
    client = ThingClient(tds=[...], bindings=reg)

The term follows W3C WoT: a TD ``form`` is the protocol binding for an
interaction; this is the client that executes it.
