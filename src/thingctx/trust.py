"""Trust + grounding.

Two safety primitives a consumer needs before it lets an agent drive a Thing:

- **Approval gating** , a human (or policy) must say yes before a risky action
  runs. Risk is read from the TD (``tc:requiresApproval`` / ``@type
  tc:Destructive``) and/or from a policy ("any non-idempotent write", "all").
- **Grounding** , ``verify()`` checks a TD against the *live* Thing (its
  readable properties actually read, and match their declared types) so you do
  not trust a description that no longer matches reality.

Both are opt-in and have no LLM dependency.
