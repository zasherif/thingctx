# thingctx

**One description, and your model reads from and acts on a real device,
sensor, tool, or service, directly. No per-integration server.**

[**thingctx.com**](https://thingctx.com): browse real services (GitHub, Stripe,
Slack, and more) as ready-to-use Thing Descriptions.

thingctx uses the [W3C Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/WoT/) standard as a
uniform interface between an AI app and the systems it reaches. Point it at a
Thing Description and it drives the actual Thing the description names, over
that Thing's own transport. The integration is a document, not a server you
run.

A "Thing" is anything with a callable interface, not just hardware: a sensor
or a robot, but equally a REST API, a database, a SaaS product, an internal
service. A Thing Description (TD) is plain JSON that names that system's
`actions` (things to do), `properties` (state to read or write), and `events`
(things to subscribe to), plus the transport for each (HTTP, MQTT, local, and
more). thingctx reads it, hands the actions to your model as tools, and calls
each against the real system. The system's own endpoints are the server; you
write nothing server-side.

A whole TD can be this small (a weather API, no hardware in sight):

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/2022/wot/td/v1.1",
  "id": "urn:example:weather:v1",
  "title": "Weather",
  "securityDefinitions": { "bearer_sc": { "scheme": "bearer" } },
  "security": ["bearer_sc"],
  "properties": {
    "temperature": { "type": "number", "readOnly": true,
      "forms": [{ "href": "https://api.example.com/temp" }] }
  },
  "actions": {
    "forecast": {
      "input": { "type": "object", "properties": { "city": { "type": "string" } } },
      "forms": [{ "href": "https://api.example.com/forecast", "htv:methodName": "POST" }]
    }
  }
}
```

Point an agent at it:

```python
import thingctx

host = await thingctx.from_url("https://api.example.com/.well-known/wot")
print(await host.chat("what's the forecast for Cairo, and the current temperature?"))
```

The model picks the actions; thingctx routes each to its transport.

## Install

```bash
pip install thingctx[all]      # litellm + httpx + paho-mqtt + jsonschema + mcp
# or pick extras: thingctx[llm] [http] [mqtt] [validate] [mcp]
```

## Drive it directly

Own the agent loop? Read a description, get the tool specs to hand your model,
and route each call back to the Thing. Nothing in between.

```python
import thingctx

client = thingctx.ThingClient.from_registry(
    thingctx.from_arg("http://device.local/.well-known/wot"))   # a URL, folder, or TDD
specs, invoke = client.as_tools()        # specs for your model; invoke(name, args) runs a call

await invoke("pump.set_speed", {"rpm": 1500})
await client.read_property("pump.rpm")
```

Add a Thing by pointing at one more description.

## Safe by default: approval + grounding

Two opt-in layers stand between an agent and a real system.

**Approval** gates risky calls behind a human or a policy. Risk is read from the
TD (`tc:requiresApproval`, or `@type tc:Destructive`) and from a policy you pick:

```python
def approve(req):                      # sync or async; return True to allow
    return input(f"run {req.tool_name}{req.arguments}? [y/N] ").lower() == "y"

client = thingctx.ThingClient(
    tds=[td], bindings=[...], approve=approve, approve_when="declared")

await client.invoke("pump.estop")      # asks approve() first; if denied, never runs
```

`approve_when` is `declared` (default, only TD-marked risky actions),
`destructive` (the above plus any non-idempotent action and every property
write), `all`, or `never`. A gated call with no approver is **denied** , a gate
with nobody to open it stays shut. The check sits in `ThingClient.invoke`, so it
applies to the LLM loop and to direct callers alike.

**Grounding** checks a description against the *live* Thing before you trust it.
`verify()` reads every readable property and confirms it answers and matches its
declared type. It is read-only and safe , actions are never invoked.

```python
for report in await client.verify():
    assert report.ok, report.as_dict()
```

The gate is on `ThingClient.invoke`, so it holds for any caller , a hand loop,
the LLM host, or an MCP client (Claude/Copilot CLI; see
[Reach a closed agent](#reach-a-closed-agent-the-mcp-bridge) below).

Runnable: [`examples/04_trust.py`](examples/04_trust.py). Full model:
[`docs/TRUST.md`](docs/TRUST.md).

## Reach a closed agent: the MCP bridge

Some agents are closed: you can't hand their model tools directly, only
through MCP (Claude Desktop, the Claude CLI, Copilot). For those, thingctx
ships one generic MCP server that turns a registry of descriptions (a folder,
a URL, or a W3C Thing Description Directory) into MCP tools, with no
per-integration server.

```bash
pip install "thingctx[mcp,http]"
thingctx-mcp ./examples/registry/        # a folder, a URL, or a TD Directory
```

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "things": { "command": "thingctx-mcp",
  "args": ["./examples/registry/"] } } }
```

Risky tools are gated here too (see [Safe by default](#safe-by-default-approval--grounding)
above): the bridge sends MCP destructive hints and asks the client to confirm a
gated call (elicitation); decline , or a client that can't ask , means denied.
Pick the policy with `THINGCTX_APPROVE_WHEN` (`declared` default, or
`destructive` / `all` / `never`):

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "things": { "command": "thingctx-mcp", "args": ["./examples/registry/"],
  "env": { "THINGCTX_APPROVE_WHEN": "destructive" } } } }
```

MCP is just one way to deliver the description, for agents where direct tool
calling isn't available.

## Why not MCP

MCP solves the wrong problem. Calling a real system from a model was always a
tooling limitation, not a protocol one: read an interface, hand the model tool
specs, route each call to its transport , all client-side, drivable from a plain
description. MCP turns that gap into infrastructure you operate instead of data
you read.

To expose a system over MCP you write a server, deploy it, and keep it running,
one per integration. N systems means N processes to operate. A Thing Description
is a static file: write it (or generate it), check it into git, or serve it from
a URL. There is nothing to run, nothing to keep alive. Integration becomes data,
not a service, and data scales to a fleet for free.

A messy device (binary protocol, a session dance) gets one thin connector that
exposes a clean WoT face; the TD describes *that*. The connector is consumed
the same way by an LLM, an MCP client, or anything else.

See [`examples/01_mcp_baseline.py`](examples/01_mcp_baseline.py) (a server per
integration) and
[`examples/02_thingctx_baseline.py`](examples/02_thingctx_baseline.py) (no
server). Both drive the same pump; every result is asserted equal to calling
the system directly. The difference is what you build and run to get there:

| per integration     | MCP (stdio) | MCP (http)   | thingctx |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------- |
| server process       | per session | 1, long-run  | 0        |
| hand-written lines   | 142         | 142          | 10       |
| time to first call   | 540 ms      | 13 ms        | 2 ms     |

thingctx calls in milliseconds because there is no server to start. MCP needs
one, and the transport sets the cost: stdio spawns it per session (the first
call pays process startup, 540 ms), streamable-HTTP is a server you keep running
and connect to (13 ms, warm). Once connected, per-call latency is small for all
three; the difference is the server you build and run to get there. The Thing
Description is data, about 145 lines of JSON, written once and read by every
consumer. Reproduce with `python examples/_measure.py`.

## Interoperability

thingctx consumes a Thing Description no matter who wrote it, including TDs emitted
by standards-compliant producers, not just hand-written ones. Two demos under
[`examples/interop/`](examples/interop/) prove it end to end:

- [**node-wot**](examples/interop/nodewot/): the
  [W3C WoT reference implementation](https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/node-wot)
  exposes a `counter` Thing; thingctx fetches its served TD and drives it
  (read, increment, read) with no node-wot client in the loop.
- [**Eclipse Ditto**](examples/interop/ditto/): Ditto generates a TD for a
  digital twin; thingctx consumes it and round-trips twin state straight
  through Ditto's API.

Same consumer, different producers, zero glue: any conformant TD producer →
thingctx.

## And UTCP

[UTCP](https://www.utcp.io/) shares thingctx's thesis: the integration is a
description the client reads, not a server you operate. The difference is the
description. UTCP defines its own *manual* format and ships SDKs in several
languages today. thingctx builds on the **ratified [W3C Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/WoT/)
Thing Description** instead, which buys four things a bespoke manual does not:

- **One format for devices and APIs.** A TD describes a REST endpoint, an MQTT
  topic, an SSE event stream, or a piece of hardware in the same document, so an
  agent reaches an industrial gateway and a SaaS API through one interface.
- **Discovery built in.** The [WoT Thing Description Directory](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-discovery/)
  is a standard for serving and searching a whole fleet of Things; thingctx reads
  any compliant TDD.
- **Vendor-neutral and stable.** It is a W3C Recommendation, not a single
  project's schema, so a TD you write is portable across consumers.
- **Built for device interaction patterns.** A TD models properties, actions,
  and **events** as first-class affordances, so a consumer can observe a property
  or subscribe to a stream of readings straight from the description. UTCP's
  manual centers on describing callable tools; event subscription is not part of
  what it defines.

The trade-off: UTCP's manual is lighter to hand-write and UTCP ships more
language clients today. thingctx bets that a ratified standard, read the same way
by an LLM, an MCP client, and a factory gateway, is worth that.

## Reference

### ThingClient: the core

Stdlib only, with no dependency on any agent framework. `ThingClient` has no
LLM and no opinion on what chose the action. It reads properties, writes them,
and streams events, and routes each call to the transport the TD's form names,
so one client can read over HTTP and subscribe over MQTT without you wiring
either:

```python
await client.read_property("pump.rpm")          # e.g. an HTTP GET
await client.write_property("pump.target_rpm", 1500)
async for evt in await client.subscribe("pump.overheat"):   # e.g. an MQTT topic
    ...                              # evt is the payload, e.g. {"temp": 98}
```

(`thingctx.from_url(...)` returns a ready `LLMHost` if you just want a loop out
of the box.)

### Registry

Where descriptions come from: a folder of files, a URL, or a **Thing
Description Directory** (TDD). `ThingClient`, the MCP bridge, and the LLM loop
all build from the same registry.

```python
client = thingctx.ThingClient.from_registry(thingctx.from_arg("./examples/registry/"))
```

The hosted registry at [thingctx.com](https://thingctx.com) is one such source.

The TDD is the [W3C WoT Discovery](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-discovery/)
standard (a final Recommendation): a service that serves a whole fleet of
Things from a `/things` endpoint, with optional search. thingctx reads from any
compliant TDD. Point `from_arg` at its URL.

### Authentication

The TD declares the scheme (`bearer`, `basic`, `apikey`); the secret is
supplied to the binding at runtime, never in the TD, so a TD is safe to commit
and share. Secrets are keyed by Thing id, then slug, then scheme name, so one
client can carry a different secret per Thing.

```python
thingctx.HttpBinding(credentials={"weather": "secret"})  # by Thing id/slug, or scheme name
```
