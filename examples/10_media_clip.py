"""10, a vision model over a clip: 08, but several frames over time.

08 showed one frame; a single still can't show motion. Image-only models (and
MCP) can't take a video container, so the portable clip is a handful of frames
sampled over time and sent as a sequence of stills. `see()` takes the list and
reads it as motion; no new model capability required.

Runs fully local with no API key (see pick_vlm_model). For a native video clip
with audio, see 11_media_video.py.

Setup once if you have no vision model::  ollama pull qwen3-vl:2b
Run::  python examples/10_media_clip.py
