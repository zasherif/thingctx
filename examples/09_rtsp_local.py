"""09, authenticated RTSP, end to end and fully local: an RTSP server that
requires a username and password, consumed with thingctx.

This is how a real IP camera works. The TD declares ``basic`` security; the secret
is handed to the client at runtime, and the MediaBinding resolves it into the RTSP
URL userinfo via the same ``resolve_credentials`` primitive HTTP and MQTT use. The
TD carries no secret.

    MediaMTX (RTSP :8554, reading requires auth)
        ^ ffmpeg publishes a test pattern  ->  rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/cam
    thingctx reads with basic credentials  ->  decoded frames

Needs two binaries on PATH::  brew install mediamtx ffmpeg
Run::  python examples/09_rtsp_local.py
