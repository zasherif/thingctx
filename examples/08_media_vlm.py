"""08, thingctx + a vision model: 03's pattern, now with an image.

03 let an LLM drive a Thing's actions. 08 is the same wiring (`from_td(...,
model=...)`), but the Thing is a camera and the model is a VLM: `host.see(frame,
...)` instead of `host.chat(...)`. A frame is pulled off the stream with
`client.frames()` and handed to the model. Only `see` differs from `chat`.

Runs fully local with no API key, using the smallest local Ollama vision model
you have pulled (see pick_vlm_model).

Setup once if you have no vision model::  ollama pull qwen3-vl:2b
Run::  python examples/08_media_vlm.py
