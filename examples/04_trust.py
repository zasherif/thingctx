"""04, trust: the safety layer that protects against a wrong decision , by a
human, by an LLM, or by an MCP client (Claude / Copilot CLI).

Same pump as 02/03. The new thing is a trust gate on the client:

  - approval , a risky call (here, any non-idempotent action under the
    "destructive" policy) is routed to an approver, which may deny it. A
    denied call never reaches the device.
  - grounding , verify() reads the TD against the live pump and reports whether
    it still matches (declared types vs. real values).

The same gate sits on ``ThingClient.invoke``, so it protects:
  * a hand-written loop (Part A),
  * an LLM driving the Thing (Part B), and
  * an MCP client over the bridge (Part C note) , Claude/Copilot CLI calls go
    through the same invoke path, and the bridge asks them to confirm a gated
    call via MCP elicitation.

Run::  python examples/04_trust.py
       (Part B uses a local Ollama model or an API key if present; see _pump)
